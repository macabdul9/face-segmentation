# Face(Eyes and Mouth) Segmentation
###### Dataset: Cheng-Han Lee et. al. "MaskGAN: Towards Diverse and Interactive Facial Image Manipulation", Github:https://github.com/switchablenorms/CelebAMask-HQ/blob/master/README.md

### Directory Description
- Notebook subdirectory contains two notebooks one named Exploratory Data Analysis.ipynnb for preprocessing(combining the masks and organizing them into a directory), analysis and other one named Eyes and Lips Segmentation.ipynb in which segmented is performed and results have been visualized
- weights subdirectory contains the trained weight for the used model
- in root directroy unet.png which is the architecture of unet(with little diff ), index.png is the visualized result and requirements.txt file contains the libraries required. 

### Requirements
- Python3.5
- Install the dependencies with command
  - pip install -r equirements.txt
